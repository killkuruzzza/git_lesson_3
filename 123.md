# Instructions for GIT
________
## How to Start
Firstly we have to initialize Git in the folder we work in. It means *"Creating Repository"*

## How to "Branch"
We can use different branches of Git to make kind of a *TreeView* of our repository. By the default we have one branch named "master"
To check where are we currently situated, we whould:
* Type **Git Branch** 

To reach the *TreeView* firstly we should make another branch, then we should:
* Type **Git Branch "*Branch_name*"**  

To switch to our brant new branch we should just:
* Type **Git checkout "*Branch_name*"**

And to start commiting here, do:
* Type **Git add *filename.xx*** 

then as usual

* Type **Git commit -m *"your message to commit"***- to finally create your commit in the branch
##How to Merge
After we worked in several branches, we might want to merge all them up in the common place. This place is branch called *"Master"* so we should go there:
* **Type Git checkout master**
* Type **Git merge "*Branch_name*"** - where **Branch_name** is the branch you want to include in the master branch. 
##How to Delete
To get rid of unnececcary trash out of your code, we should clean things up after merging. So simply delete the branch that was finished and merged into the master branch
* Type **Git branch -d "*Branch_name*"** - this branch will be deleted.

# Switching and comparing
For sure we have to roam from aommit to commit and compare versions, so we have told for that:
* Type **git log** to see all the current commits
* Type **git log --oneline** affords to shorten the output and to see only ID and message of commits

Now we are ready to switch from current commit to another.
 **Don't forget to commit before, if you have unsaved changes!**
 To switch to another commit simply copy first 4-5 digits from the ID of commit (find it in the log) and:
 * Type **git checkout ***XXXXX***** where XXXXX is the first 5 digits if ID of the commit.
 
 To return to the main version of the file, to the master branch
 * Type **Type Git checkout master**

To compare commits do:
* Type **Type Git diff ***XXXXX***** where XXXXX is the first 5 digits if ID of the commit you want to compare with the last one in the current branch.



##How to work w/ hub

Mainly we have 2 ways of working: **push** n **pull**

**Push** is dedicated to send local repo to the net.

**Pull** is to load changes from Hub directly - so doing request from your browser to load changes from local file to the net.
These are the basics of using vervion controlling tool called "Git".

To perform **Push** we need firstly to create a repo in the hub, where we will send our local repo.
Login into github, create repo, copy appeared link to it.
After that in our code on VSC we should type several lines to the terminal, about switching master branch to main, then -u the main branch to remote origin woth the link


Thanks. A lot.
